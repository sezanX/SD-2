## Bangladesh Tax Calculator (Android)

**Project Overview:**

This repository contains the source code for an Android application designed to assist individual taxpayers in Bangladesh with estimating their annual income tax liability. It provides a user-friendly interface based on Material Design principles.

**Current Features (Version 1.0):**

*   **Income & Investment Input:** Fields for Annual Basic Salary, Bonus, Other Taxable Income, and Eligible Investment.
*   **Taxpayer Categorization:** Selection of taxpayer type (General, Female, Senior Citizen, Disabled, Third Gender, Freedom Fighter) to apply appropriate tax-free income thresholds based on **AY 2024-25 rules (as per provided data - needs NBR verification)**.
*   **Dynamic Tax Slab Display:** Shows the general tax slab structure and updates the initial tax-free range display based on the selected category.
*   **Tax Calculation:** Computes Gross Taxable Income (using placeholder exemptions), Tax Payable Before Rebate, Investment Rebate (using placeholder rules), and Net Tax Payable (applying placeholder Minimum Tax).
*   **PDF Report Generation:** Creates a summary PDF of the calculated tax details.
*   **PDF Sharing:** Allows sharing the generated PDF via standard Android share functionality using FileProvider/MediaStore.
*   **Developer Information:** A dedicated screen showing developer contact details and links.

**Technology Stack:**

*   **Language:** Kotlin
*   **UI:** XML Layouts with Material Design Components (MaterialCardView, TextInputLayout, MaterialButton, Spinner, etc.)
*   **Architecture:** Activity-based with View Binding
*   **Core Libraries:** AndroidX AppCompat, Material Components, AndroidX Core, FileProvider

**Important Disclaimer:**

The tax calculation logic, including tax-free limits, slab amounts/rates, exemption rules, rebate formulas, and minimum tax values, are based on information available during development or general examples (**particularly for AY 2024-25 examples**). These **must be verified against the latest official National Board of Revenue (NBR) circulars** for the specific assessment year before relying on the calculations for official tax filing. **This application is intended as an estimation tool only.**

**Future Development:**

*   Implementation of accurate, verifiable NBR rules for all calculations.
*   Detailed exemption input and calculation logic.
*   User input for location to determine correct Minimum Tax.
*   Assessment Year selection feature.
*   Data persistence.
*   Localization (Bengali language support).
*   Unit and UI testing.
