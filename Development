### 1. Project Goal & Overview

**Goal:** To create an Android application that allows users in Bangladesh to estimate their annual income tax based on provided income, investment details, and taxpayer category, adhering to NBR rules (as understood during development). The app should feature a modern UI, provide a tax summary, display relevant tax slabs, offer a PDF report generation/sharing feature, and include developer information.

**Core Features Developed:**

1.  User input for Annual Basic Salary, Bonus, Other Taxable Income, and Eligible Investment.
2.  Selection of Taxpayer Category (General, Female, Senior, Disabled, Third Gender, Freedom Fighter) via a Spinner.
3.  Calculation of Gross Taxable Income (with placeholder exemptions), Tax Payable Before Rebate, Investment Rebate, and Net Tax Payable based on selected category and NBR rules (placeholder/example rules implemented).
4.  Display of the general tax slab structure, dynamically updating the first (tax-free) slab range based on the selected category.
5.  Display of calculated tax summary results.
6.  Generation of a PDF summary report of the calculation, saved to the device's Downloads folder (using MediaStore or FileProvider).
7.  Sharing functionality for the generated PDF report.
8.  An "Options Menu" item to navigate to a dedicated "Developer Info" screen.
9.  A "Developer Info" screen displaying developer details, including clickable links for Email, GitHub, and LinkedIn.
10. Modern UI using Material Design Components and CardViews.
11. Handling for potential Status Bar overlap issues.

### 3. Step-by-Step Development Process

This outlines the major phases and steps undertaken to build the application based on the iterative process.

**Phase 1: Project Setup and Resource Configuration**

1.  **Create Project:** Started a new Android Studio project. Selected "Empty Activity" template (which defaulted to Compose, later adapted for Views/XML) with Kotlin as the language.
2.  **Add Dependencies:** Modified the `app/build.gradle` (or `build.gradle.kts`) file to include necessary dependencies for XML-based UI development alongside existing Compose dependencies:
    *   `androidx.appcompat:appcompat`
    *   `com.google.android.material:material` (Crucial for Material Design)
    *   `androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout`
    *   `androidx.cardview:cardview`
3.  **Enable View Binding:** Enabled View Binding in the `app/build.gradle` file's `android { buildFeatures { ... } }` block for type-safe view access.
4.  **Define Colors (`colors.xml`):** Created a color palette matching the desired light UI theme (light backgrounds, white surfaces, primary blue accent, distinct text colors, status green).
5.  **Define Strings (`strings.xml`):** Externalized all user-facing text, including titles, labels, hints, button text, error messages, taxpayer categories (for Spinner and internal checks), tax slab ranges/rates (placeholders), developer info text, URLs, and accessibility descriptions.
6.  **Configure Theme & Styles (`themes.xml`, `styles.xml`):**
    *   Set the base application theme in `themes.xml` to inherit from a Material 3 theme (`Theme.Material3.DayNight.NoActionBar`), disabling the default ActionBar.
    *   Configured primary, surface, background, and text colors in the theme.
    *   Enabled edge-to-edge display by setting `statusBarColor` to match the background and using `windowLightStatusBar`.
    *   Defined default styles (`Widget.App.*`) for `MaterialCardView`, `MaterialButton`, `TextInputLayout`, and `Toolbar` within `themes.xml`.
    *   Created `styles.xml` to define reusable text appearances (`TextAppearance.App.*`) for different elements (Card Titles, Labels, Values, Links, Slab Text) and layout styles (`ResultRowLayout`, `SlabRowLayout`, `AppDivider`).
7.  **Color State List (`text_input_box_stroke.xml`):** Created a color state list in `res/color/` to define the stroke color for `TextInputLayout` based on its state (focused, default).
8.  **Define Attributes (`attrs.xml`):** Defined a custom attribute `statusBarHeight` as a fallback, although programmatic inset handling was preferred later.
9.  **Update Manifest (`AndroidManifest.xml`):** Set the `android:theme` attribute in the `<application>` tag to use the defined app theme (`Theme.TaxCalculatorBD`).
10. **Create Drawables:**
    *   `ic_check_circle.xml`: Vector asset for the "Filed" status (initially planned, later removed from the specific requirement).
    *   `bg_spinner.xml`: Shape drawable for the Spinner background/border.
    *   `dev_profile_pic.jpg/png`: Added the developer's image to the `drawable` folder.

**Phase 2: UI Layout Implementation (XML)**

1.  **`item_tax_quarter.xml` (Initial - Later Deleted):** Initially created a reusable layout for displaying quarterly tax status, using `ConstraintLayout`. This was later removed as the requirement changed.
2.  **`activity_main.xml`:**
    *   Chose `CoordinatorLayout` with `AppBarLayout` and `NestedScrollView` for the main structure to handle potential scrolling behaviors and Status Bar insets effectively.
    *   Added `android:fitsSystemWindows="true"` to the `AppBarLayout` to prevent overlap with the Status Bar.
    *   Implemented the `MaterialToolbar` with a nested `ConstraintLayout` to position the title (`toolbar_title`) and the year selection button (`buttonYear`).
    *   Inside the `NestedScrollView`, used a `LinearLayout` (vertical) to stack `MaterialCardView`s.
    *   **Input Card (`cardInput`):** Added `TextInputLayout` / `TextInputEditText` for Basic Salary, Bonus, Other Income, and Investment. Added a `Spinner` (`spinnerTaxpayerCategory`) with a label for category selection. Added the "Calculate Tax" `MaterialButton` (`buttonCalculate`).
    *   **Results Card (`cardResults`):** Created a card (initially `visibility="gone"`) to display the summary using `LinearLayout`s and styled `TextView`s for labels and values (`textGrossIncomeResult`, `textTaxBeforeRebateResult`, etc.). Included a "Generate PDF Report" `MaterialButton` (`buttonGeneratePdf`).
    *   **Registration Fee Card (Initial - Later Deleted):** Created a card to display registration info, later removed based on requirement change.
    *   **Tax Slabs Card (`cardTaxSlabs` - Replaced Percentage Tax):** Created a card to display income tax slabs. Included a title `TextView`, header `LinearLayout`, and multiple `LinearLayout`s (using `SlabRowLayout` style) to display each slab's range and rate using `TextView`s styled with `SlabRangeText` and `SlabRateText`. Added an ID (`textSlab1Range`) to the first slab's range TextView for dynamic updates. Added disclaimer notes at the bottom.
3.  **`activity_developer_info.xml`:**
    *   Used `CoordinatorLayout` and `AppBarLayout` with `fitsSystemWindows="true"` for consistency and Status Bar handling.
    *   Included a `MaterialToolbar` (`toolbarDevInfo`) with a back navigation icon (`app:navigationIcon="?attr/homeAsUpIndicator"`).
    *   Used a central `MaterialCardView` inside a `NestedScrollView`.
    *   Inside the card, used a `LinearLayout` (vertical, centered) to display:
        *   A `ShapeableImageView` (`imageDevProfile`) with circular shape appearance (`ShapeAppearance.App.CircleImageView` style).
        *   `TextView`s for Name, University, Department, Session/ID.
        *   A divider (`View` with `AppDivider` style).
        *   Contact section title.
        *   `LinearLayout`s (horizontal) containing label and value `TextView`s for Email (`textEmail`), GitHub (`textGithub`), and LinkedIn (`textLinkedin`). The value TextViews used the `TextAppearance.App.Link` style and had padding added (`14dp`) to increase touch target size.
4.  **Menu (`main_menu.xml`):** Created a menu resource file defining an item (`action_developer_info`) to launch the Developer Info screen, set to `showAsAction="never"` (appears in the overflow menu).
5.  **FileProvider Paths (`provider_paths.xml`):** Created an XML resource defining the paths accessible via `FileProvider` (specifically the external `Download/` directory) for PDF sharing.

**Phase 3: Core Logic & Feature Implementation (Kotlin)**

1.  **`MainActivity.kt`:**
    *   **Setup:** Changed inheritance to `AppCompatActivity`. Implemented View Binding (`ActivityMainBinding`). Called setup functions in `onCreate`. Set the Toolbar using `setSupportActionBar`.
    *   **Spinner:** Implemented `setupTaxpayerCategorySpinner` to populate the Spinner from the string array and set an `OnItemSelectedListener`.
    *   **Slab Display Update:** Implemented `updateSlabDisplayCard` to change the text of the first tax slab range (`binding.textSlab1Range`) based on the Spinner's selected position. This listener also resets calculation results when the category changes.
    *   **Button Listeners:** Implemented `setupButtonClickListeners` to handle clicks for "Calculate Tax", "Year", and "Generate PDF".
    *   **Input Handling:** Implemented `getInputAsDouble` to safely parse input, handle errors, and show messages on `TextInputLayout`.
    *   **Tax Calculation:**
        *   Defined constants for tax-free limits, slab amounts, slab rates, rebate rules, and minimum tax (marked as **EXAMPLES/PLACEHOLDERS requiring NBR verification**).
        *   Implemented `getTaxFreeLimit` to return the correct threshold based on the Spinner selection.
        *   Implemented `calculateTaxSlabs` using the selected tax-free limit and slab constants.
        *   Implemented `calculateRebate` using the taxable income, investment, and rebate constants.
        *   Implemented `calculateAndDisplayTax` to orchestrate the entire calculation flow, including placeholder exemption logic and minimum tax application. Stored results in member variables.
    *   **Display:** Implemented `displayResults` to format numbers as BDT currency using `NumberFormat` and update the UI. Implemented `formatCurrency`.
    *   **PDF Generation & Sharing:**
        *   Implemented `generatePdfReport` using `PdfDocument` and `Canvas` to draw the tax summary.
        *   Handled file saving using `MediaStore` (API 29+) or `FileProvider` via external cache (below API 29).
        *   Triggered the `sharePdf` function upon successful save.
    *   **Sharing:** Implemented `sharePdf` using `ACTION_SEND` intent, `FileProvider.getUriForFile` (when needed), MIME type `application/pdf`, and `FLAG_GRANT_READ_URI_PERMISSION`.
    *   **Options Menu:** Implemented `onCreateOptionsMenu` and `onOptionsItemSelected` to inflate the menu and launch `DeveloperInfoActivity` when the item is clicked.
    *   **Helpers:** Included `hideKeyboard`.
2.  **`DeveloperInfoActivity.kt`:**
    *   **Setup:** Changed inheritance to `AppCompatActivity`. Implemented View Binding (`ActivityDeveloperInfoBinding`). Set the Toolbar and enabled the Up/Back button (`supportActionBar?.setDisplayHomeAsUpEnabled(true)`).
    *   **Back Navigation:** Implemented `onOptionsItemSelected` to handle the Up/Back button click using `onBackPressedDispatcher`.
    *   **Link Listeners:** Implemented `setupLinkListeners` to handle clicks on Email, GitHub, and LinkedIn TextViews.
    *   **Intent Handling:** Used `ACTION_SENDTO` (for email) and `ACTION_VIEW` (for web URLs) Intents to open the respective apps/browsers. Included `try-catch` blocks for `ActivityNotFoundException`.
    *   **(Removed):** Initially had code for programmatic edge-to-edge handling (`WindowCompat`, `applyStatusBarInset`), which was removed when `fitsSystemWindows="true"` was added to the layout's `AppBarLayout`.
3.  **`AndroidManifest.xml`:**
    *   Declared `DeveloperInfoActivity`, setting `MainActivity` as its parent for Up navigation.
    *   Declared the `FileProvider`, linking it to `@xml/provider_paths` and defining the authority.
    *   Ensured `MainActivity` had the `LAUNCHER` intent filter. Added `INTERNET` permission (for opening web links).

**Phase 4: Error Fixing & Refinement**

1.  **Resource Linking Errors:** Addressed errors like "resource string/X not found" by ensuring all referenced strings/drawables/styles existed. Fixed "profile_image_desc" string issue.
2.  **ViewBinding "Unresolved reference":** Resolved errors like `Unresolved reference 'toolbarDevInfo'` or `Unresolved reference 'textSlab1Range'` by ensuring correct IDs in XML and performing `Build -> Clean Project` followed by `Build -> Rebuild Project`. Used `Invalidate Caches / Restart` when necessary.
3.  **Default Activity Not Found:** Corrected the `AndroidManifest.xml` to ensure `MainActivity` had the necessary `<intent-filter>` with `ACTION_MAIN` and `CATEGORY_LAUNCHER`, and `android:exported="true"`.
4.  **Status Bar Overlap:** Fixed the issue where the Toolbar content was drawn under the Status Bar by:
    *   Initially trying programmatic insets (`applyStatusBarInset`).
    *   Switching to the more standard approach for `CoordinatorLayout`: adding `android:fitsSystemWindows="true"` to the `AppBarLayout` in both `activity_main.xml` and `activity_developer_info.xml`.
5.  **Accessibility Warnings:** Addressed "Touch target size too small" warnings by adding padding (`14dp`) to clickable TextViews (`textEmail`, etc.) in `activity_developer_info.xml` and increasing `minHeight` for buttons in styles. Acknowledged "Insufficient text color contrast" warnings, suggesting color adjustments but leaving them for fine-tuning. Ignored "is too wide" warnings for `match_parent` elements within cards as intended design.

### 7. Building and Running the Application

1.  **Open Project:** Open the project directory in Android Studio.
2.  **Sync Gradle:** Ensure Gradle sync completes successfully (`File -> Sync Project with Gradle Files`).
3.  **Select Device/Emulator:** Choose a connected Android device (with USB Debugging enabled) or an emulator.
4.  **Run App:** Click the Run button (green play icon) or use the `Shift + F10` shortcut. Android Studio will build and install the app on the selected target.
5.  **(Optional) Build APK:** To create an installable APK file (for manual installation/sharing):
    *   Go to `Build -> Build Bundle(s) / APK(s) -> Build APK(s)`.
    *   Wait for the build to finish.
    *   Click the "locate" link in the notification popup or navigate to `YourProjectFolder/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`.
    *   Find the `app-debug.apk` file.
6.  **(Optional) Manual Installation:**
    *   Enable "Install from unknown sources" for your file manager app on the target Android device (in device Settings -> Apps -> Special app access or similar).
    *   Transfer the `app-debug.apk` file to the device (via USB, cloud storage, etc.).
    *   Use the file manager app on the device to locate and tap the APK file to install it.

### 8. Known Limitations and Future Work

*   **Tax Rule Accuracy:** The implemented tax rules (slabs, rates, exemptions, rebate calculations, minimum tax) are **placeholders/examples**. They **must be updated based on the latest official NBR circulars** for the relevant assessment year for the app to be accurate and reliable. Different rules for specific taxpayer categories need full implementation.
*   **Detailed Exemptions:** The app currently uses highly simplified placeholder logic for exemptions. A future version should include specific input fields or sections for House Rent, Medical Allowance, Conveyance, LFA, Provident Fund contributions, etc., and apply NBR rules correctly.
*   **Minimum Tax Logic:** Minimum tax calculation needs input for the user's location (Dhaka/Ctg City Corp, Other City Corp, Other Areas) and potentially other factors as per NBR rules.
*   **Assessment Year Selection:** The year button is currently non-functional. Implement a DatePicker or selection mechanism and load/apply tax rules dynamically based on the selected year.
*   **PDF Report Customization:** The generated PDF is basic. Options for adding more details (like input values), company logos, or better formatting could be added.
*   **Input Validation:** More robust input validation (e.g., preventing negative numbers where inappropriate, handling large numbers better) can be added.
*   **Data Persistence:** User inputs are lost when the app closes. Use SharedPreferences or a simple database (like Room) to save the last entered values or user profiles.
*   **UI/UX Refinements:** Add animations, improve visual feedback, enhance error messages, and refine the overall user flow. Consider adding icons to input fields or results.
*   **Localization:** Translate all strings in `strings.xml` to Bengali.
*   **Testing:** Implement Unit Tests for calculation logic and UI tests (Espresso) for user interactions. Test thoroughly across different devices and Android versions.
*   **Runtime Permissions:** If targeting Android versions below 10 and using the external storage fallback for PDF, implement runtime requests for `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`.

### 9. Conclusion

This documentation details the development of the Bangladesh Tax Calculator app, from initial setup to the implementation of core features like category-based calculation and PDF reporting/sharing. While the app provides a solid foundation and a modern UI, **critical attention must be paid to verifying and implementing the exact NBR tax rules** for accuracy before any real-world use. Future enhancements can further improve its functionality, usability, and reliability.
