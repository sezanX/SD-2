## Bangladesh Tax Calculator: Calculation Logic & Algorithm Documentation

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** April 23, 2024

### 1. Purpose

This document details the algorithms and mathematical steps implemented within the `MainActivity.kt` file for calculating estimated income tax liability for individuals in Bangladesh. It covers input handling, exemption application (placeholders), tax slab computation, investment rebate calculation, minimum tax application, and currency formatting, as well as the logic for generating the PDF report content.

**Disclaimer:** The specific tax rules, rates, limits, and exemption formulas implemented are based on information provided during development (e.g., screenshots for AY 2024-25 tax-free limits) and general understanding. **These are EXAMPLE/PLACEHOLDER values and logic.** For accurate calculations, these **must be verified and updated according to the latest official National Board of Revenue (NBR) circulars** for the specific assessment year. This application should be used as an estimation tool only.

### 2. Core Calculation Data Flow

The tax calculation process follows these general steps:

1.  **Input Acquisition:** Read Annual Basic Salary, Bonus, Other Taxable Income, and Eligible Investment from user input fields. Validate the input.
2.  **Taxpayer Category Identification:** Determine the selected taxpayer category from the Spinner to apply the correct tax-free income limit.
3.  **Exemption Calculation (Placeholder):** Apply predefined (example) rules to calculate deductible amounts for items like House Rent, Medical Allowance, etc., based primarily on Basic Salary.
4.  **Gross Taxable Income Calculation:** Subtract total calculated exemptions from the total income (Basic + Bonus + Other) to arrive at the income amount subject to tax slabs.
5.  **Gross Tax Calculation (`calculateTaxSlabs`):** Calculate the total tax payable based on the applicable tax slabs and rates *before* considering any investment rebate. This uses the Tax-Free Limit determined in step 2.
6.  **Investment Rebate Calculation (`calculateRebate`):** Calculate the eligible tax rebate based on the Gross Taxable Income, the user-provided investment amount, and NBR rules regarding eligible investment limits and the rebate rate.
7.  **Net Tax Calculation (Pre-Minimum):** Subtract the calculated Investment Rebate from the Gross Tax Calculated.
8.  **Minimum Tax Application:** Compare the result from step 7 with the applicable Minimum Tax (based on location/status - *currently placeholder*). The Net Tax Payable is the higher of these two values (but only if taxable income exceeds the tax-free limit).
9.  **Result Display:** Format the calculated values as BDT currency and display them in the "Tax Summary" UI card.
10. **Store Results:** Save the final calculated values in member variables for potential use in PDF generation.

### 3. Detailed Algorithm Implementation (`MainActivity.kt`)

#### 3.1. Input Handling (`getInputAsDouble` function)

*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Read the text from the provided `TextInputEditText`.
    2.  Trim leading/trailing whitespace.
    3.  Clear any previous error message on the associated `TextInputLayout`.
    4.  Replace any commas (`,`) with empty strings to handle user input like "1,000,000".
    5.  Check if the resulting string is empty.
        *   If empty AND `isRequired` is true, set an error on `TextInputLayout` and return `null`.
        *   If empty AND `isRequired` is false, return `0.0`.
    6.  Attempt to parse the string to a `Double` using `toDouble()`.
    7.  If parsing succeeds, return the `Double` value.
    8.  If `NumberFormatException` occurs during parsing, set an error on `TextInputLayout` and return `null`.
*   **Implementation Notes:** Returns a nullable `Double` (`Double?`) to clearly signal success (Double value) or failure (null). Uses `coerceAtLeast(0.0)` later on income totals derived from these inputs.

#### 3.2. Determining Tax-Free Limit (`getTaxFreeLimit` function)

*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Check if the `Spinner` adapter is initialized and an item is selected. If not, return the default `TAX_FREE_LIMIT_GENERAL`.
    2.  Get the `selectedItemPosition` from the `spinnerTaxpayerCategory`.
    3.  Use a `when` statement based on the `selectedItemPosition`:
        *   Match the position to the corresponding category (assuming the order in the `string-array` matches the logic: 0=General, 1=Female, 2=Senior, etc.).
        *   Return the appropriate predefined constant (`TAX_FREE_LIMIT_GENERAL`, `TAX_FREE_LIMIT_FEMALE_SENIOR`, etc.).
*   **Implementation Notes:** Compares based on item position for robustness against minor string changes. Constants hold the specific threshold values based on the provided image (AY 2024-25 examples). **Requires verification and potential updates based on official NBR data.**

#### 3.3. Exemption Calculation (Inside `calculateAndDisplayTax` - Placeholder)

*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  **House Rent:** Calculate `Basic Salary * 0.5`. Find the minimum of this value and the annual cap (e.g., 300,000).
    2.  **Medical:** Calculate `Basic Salary * 0.1`. Find the minimum of this value and the annual cap (e.g., 120,000).
    3.  **Conveyance:** Use a fixed annual amount (e.g., 30,000).
    4.  Sum these calculated exemption amounts.
*   **Implementation Notes:** This is highly simplified. **Actual NBR rules are more complex** and may depend on actual rent paid, medical expenses incurred, whether the employer provides benefits, etc. This section needs significant refinement for accuracy. Currently, it assumes the exemptions apply directly to the total income.

#### 3.4. Gross Taxable Income Calculation (Inside `calculateAndDisplayTax`)

*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Sum `basicSalary + bonus + otherIncome` to get `totalIncomeBeforeExemptions`.
    2.  Subtract the sum of calculated (placeholder) exemptions from `totalIncomeBeforeExemptions`.
    3.  Ensure the result is not negative using `coerceAtLeast(0.0)`.
*   **Implementation Notes:** The accuracy depends heavily on the correctness of the Exemption calculation.

#### 3.5. Tax Slab Calculation (`calculateTaxSlabs` function)

*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Call `getTaxFreeLimit()` to get the applicable threshold (`taxFreeLimit`).
    2.  If `income <= taxFreeLimit`, return `0.0`.
    3.  Initialize `tax = 0.0`.
    4.  Calculate `remainingIncome = income - taxFreeLimit`.
    5.  **For Slab 1 (e.g., next 100k @ 5%):**
        *   `taxableInSlab = remainingIncome.coerceAtMost(SLAB_AMOUNT_1)`
        *   If `taxableInSlab > 0`, `tax += taxableInSlab * SLAB_RATE_1`.
        *   `remainingIncome -= taxableInSlab`.
        *   If `remainingIncome <= 0`, return `tax`.
    6.  **For Slab 2 (e.g., next 400k @ 10%):**
        *   `taxableInSlab = remainingIncome.coerceAtMost(SLAB_AMOUNT_2)`
        *   If `taxableInSlab > 0`, `tax += taxableInSlab * SLAB_RATE_2`.
        *   `remainingIncome -= taxableInSlab`.
        *   If `remainingIncome <= 0`, return `tax`.
    7.  **Repeat** for subsequent slabs (`SLAB_AMOUNT_3`/`SLAB_RATE_3`, `SLAB_AMOUNT_4`/`SLAB_RATE_4`).
    8.  **For the final slab (highest rate, e.g., 25%):**
        *   If `remainingIncome > 0`, `tax += remainingIncome * SLAB_RATE_5`.
    9.  Return final `tax`.
*   **Implementation Notes:** Uses predefined constants for slab *amounts* (the size of each bracket, e.g., 100k, 400k) and slab *rates*. These constants **must be verified** against NBR circulars for the correct assessment year.

#### 3.6. Investment Rebate Calculation (`calculateRebate` function)

*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Call `getTaxFreeLimit()`.
    2.  If `taxableIncome <= taxFreeLimit`, return `0.0` (no rebate applicable).
    3.  Calculate **Maximum Eligible Investment Base**:
        *   `limit1 = taxableIncome * MAX_INVESTMENT_ELIGIBLE_PERCENTAGE` (e.g., 20% of taxable income).
        *   `maxEligibleBase = min(limit1, MAX_INVESTMENT_ELIGIBLE_ABSOLUTE)` (e.g., the lower of 20% of income or 1 Crore).
    4.  Calculate **Investment Amount Considered for Rebate**:
        *   `investmentForRebateCalc = min(actualInvestment, maxEligibleBase)` (the lower of user's actual investment or the calculated max base).
    5.  Calculate **Final Rebate Amount**:
        *   `calculatedRebate = investmentForRebateCalc * REBATE_RATE` (e.g., 15% of the amount from step 4).
    6.  Return `calculatedRebate`. (Note: NBR rules should be checked for any absolute cap on the final rebate amount itself).
*   **Implementation Notes:** Uses predefined constants for percentage limits, absolute limits, and the rebate rate. **Requires NBR verification.**

#### 3.7. Net Tax Payable & Minimum Tax (Inside `calculateAndDisplayTax`)

*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Calculate initial net tax: `netTax = taxBeforeRebate - investmentRebate`.
    2.  Ensure `netTax` is not negative: `netTax = netTax.coerceAtLeast(0.0)`.
    3.  Get the applicable `taxFreeLimit` by calling `getTaxFreeLimit()`.
    4.  Check if `taxableIncome > taxFreeLimit`.
        *   If **Yes**:
            *   Determine the applicable `minimumTax` amount (e.g., `MINIMUM_TAX_OTHER_AREA` - **placeholder logic, needs input for user's area**).
            *   Calculate final `netTaxPayable = netTax.coerceAtLeast(minimumTax)` (the higher of calculated tax or minimum tax).
        *   If **No**:
            *   `netTaxPayable = 0.0` (no tax if income is within the tax-free limit).
*   **Implementation Notes:** Minimum tax logic is currently incomplete as it requires user input for location (Dhaka/Ctg City Corp, Other City Corp, Other Area) to select the correct minimum tax constant.

#### 3.8. Currency Formatting (`formatCurrency` function)

*   **Algorithm:**
    1.  Get a `NumberFormat` instance suitable for currency, specifically attempting the Bengali locale for Bangladesh (`Locale("bn", "BD")`).
    2.  Explicitly set the currency to BDT using `Currency.getInstance("BDT")`.
    3.  Set maximum and minimum fraction digits to 2.
    4.  Format the input `Double` value using `format.format(value)`.
    5.  Wrap in a `try-catch` block to handle potential `Exception` (e.g., locale/currency not supported).
    6.  In the `catch` block, use a basic fallback format (`String.format(Locale.US, "BDT %.2f", value)`).
*   **Implementation Notes:** Using `Locale("bn", "BD")` is preferred for potentially correct BDT symbol placement and grouping separators.

### 4. PDF Report Generation Algorithm (`generatePdfReport` function)

1.  **Retrieve Data:** Get the last calculated results (`taxableIncome`, `taxBeforeRebate`, etc.) and the selected category name from member variables. Check if results exist.
2.  **Initialize PDF:** Create `PdfDocument` and `PdfDocument.PageInfo` (A4 size assumed). Start page 1 and get the `Canvas`.
3.  **Setup Paints:** Create various `Paint` objects, configuring `textSize`, `color`, `textAlign`, and `isFakeBoldText` for different text elements (Title, Subtitle, Label, Value, Bold Value, Footer, Line).
4.  **Define Layout Coordinates:** Set up variables for page width (`pageW`), starting Y position (`yPos`), left/right margins, and the X position for right-aligned values (`valueStartPos`). Define standard line spacing.
5.  **Draw Title & Header:** Use `canvas.drawText` with `paintTitle` and `paintSubTitle` to draw the report title, assessment year, and taxpayer category, centering the text horizontally (`pageW / 2f`) and incrementing `yPos`.
6.  **Draw Result Rows:** For each result item (Gross Taxable Income, Tax Before Rebate, Investment Rebate, Net Tax Payable):
    *   Draw the label text (e.g., `getString(R.string.gross_taxable_income)`) at `leftMargin` using `paintLabel`.
    *   Draw the formatted currency value (e.g., `formatCurrency(taxableIncome)`) starting from `valueStartPos` (right-aligned) using `paintValue` or `paintValueBold`.
    *   Increment `yPos` by `lineSpacing`.
7.  **Draw Divider:** Use `canvas.drawLine` between rebate and net payable rows, using `paintLine`.
8.  **Draw Disclaimer & Footer:** Use `canvas.drawText` with appropriate `Paint` objects to add disclaimer text and a generation timestamp/app name footer near the bottom of the page.
9.  **Finish & Close:** Call `pdfDocument.finishPage(page)` and ensure `pdfDocument.close()` is called in a `finally` block.
10. **Save & Get URI:**
    *   Generate a unique filename with a timestamp.
    *   Use `MediaStore` (API 29+) or `FileProvider` + External Cache (below API 29) to save the `pdfDocument` to a file and obtain a content `Uri`.
11. **Trigger Share:** If a valid `Uri` is obtained, call the `sharePdf(uri)` function.
12. **Error Handling:** Use `try-catch` for `IOException` and general `Exception`, displaying `Toast` messages on failure.

### 5. Important Considerations

*   **Accuracy of Rules:** The core limitation is the dependency on hardcoded, example tax rules. **Regular updates based on official NBR circulars are paramount** for the app's usefulness.
*   **Exemptions Complexity:** Real-world exemption calculations are complex and require more detailed user input than currently implemented.
*   **Minimum Tax Location:** The app needs a way to determine the user's applicable area for correct minimum tax calculation.
*   **Floating Point Precision:** While standard `Double` is used, for financial calculations involving very large numbers or requiring extreme precision, using `BigDecimal` might be considered in future iterations, although it adds complexity.
*   **Error Handling:** Input validation and error handling can be made more robust and user-friendly.
